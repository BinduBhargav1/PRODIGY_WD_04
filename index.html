            <h2 class="heading">About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm <b style="font-size: 1.9rem">Bindu Bhargav,
                2nd year B. Tech student at VIT-AP</b>. I like technology, programming, and solving problems. I got into technology mainly out of curiosity to understand how things work. That curiosity evolved into a drive to build things that are not
                just functional, but impactful. I enjoy building responsive websites, optimizing algorithms, and diving into generative AI to see what I can do. I 'm motivated by challenges whether that's debugging difficult code, building novel solutions,
                or pushing the boundaries of what I can create. I value hands-on experience and the collaborative process, and look for opportunities to learn, grow, and bring new ideas to life. </p>
